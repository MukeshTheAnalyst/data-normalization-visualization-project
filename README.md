# From Flat File to 3NF: Normalizing Sales Data for Insightful Analysis
**Transforming a Single Raw Dataset into a Structured Relational Model Using Power Query, Excel Data Model, and Tableau**

## 📄 Project Summary

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to transforming a flat, non-normalized dataset into a robust relational model ready for modern analytics. The objective was to highlight how normalization enhances data consistency, integrity, and scalability for reporting and BI.

The process involved:
- Importing raw business data into Excel for initial assessment
- Separating the merged flat file into logical dimensions and facts
- Applying data normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Building a final relational schema in Excel
- Visualizing the cleaned and structured data in Tableau Public

This project is designed for my portfolio to illustrate expertise in data cleansing, normalization, and effective BI visualization—skills essential for any data analytics role.

## 📂 Data Source

The dataset originates from Maven Analytics educational content on YouTube. All modeling, transformation, and visualization steps were performed independently to develop a deep understanding of data normalization concepts. Data files are used strictly for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## 📁 Project Structure

/raw_files/ — Raw, merged Excel data sheet
/final_files/ — Final normalized Excel files (dimension and fact tables)
/Tableau/ — Tableau Public dashboard (.twb)
/images/ — Dashboard and model screenshots
README.md — Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

Use the raw merged Excel sheet from the /raw_files folder to review the starting dataset
Open the final normalized Excel files from /final_files to see the relational data model
Launch Global_Retail Dashboard.twb in Tableau Public to explore interactive visualizations
